# Soft-Muscle-Printing

This repository contains the code/data/model for printing Soft Artificial Muscle using Soft Muscle Printer.
The runnable jupyter notebook are [dog_bone muscle.ipynb](https://github.com/boxiXia/Soft-Muscle-Printing/blob/master/dog_bone%20muscle.ipynb) and [Soft_muscle_twisted spiral.ipynb](https://github.com/boxiXia/Soft-Muscle-Printing/blob/master/dog_bone%20muscle.ipynb)
