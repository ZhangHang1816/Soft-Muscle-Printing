CAD model for the silicone muscle printer project @CreativeMachinesLab.

The folder "mixer_design" contains the Autodesk Inventor (2018) files for the mixing and printing module, the folder "stl_model" contains the exported ".stl" files of the printing module. The z plate assembly is printed with a Stratasys J750 printer in the Creative Machines Lab. The tubing is printed using "FLX9795-dm; Shore-A:95", the other parts are printed with "VeroPureWht." @boxiXia

The folder "lasercut_electronics_housing" contains the electronic side mounting box model for the Shapeoko gantry. CAD files turned into two-dimensional drawing files are laser cut out of a 1/8 in a thick acrylic sheet. Two sheets about two feet long by 3 feet wide will be enough material for the entire assembly. The slots that connect the different sheets require 6-32 thread, Â½ in long screws and 6-32 thread square nuts. Around 50 will be enough to assemble the housing. There are two square cutouts for installing fans used for cooling the control boards @jacobjoseph
